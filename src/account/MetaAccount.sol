/**
 * @title MetaAccount
 * @notice A fee-enabled smart account that extends BaseAccount with automatic fee collection.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements a meta-transaction account that requires the first call in every batch
 * to be a valid fee payment to the configured FeeManager. This ensures that relayers can collect
 * fees for executing transactions on behalf of users.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Inherits all BaseAccount functionality (EIP-712 signing, batch execution, nonce management)
 * - Enforces fee payment as the first call in every batch
 * - Validates fee tokens through the FeeManager
 * - Supports ERC-20 token fee payments
